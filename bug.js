This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  If your app is running in the Expo Go client, and you haven't configured your app properly for handling links, you might encounter unexpected behavior such as the deep link not opening your app or opening the wrong screen. Specifically, the `Linking.addEventListener` might not trigger as expected, and `Linking.getInitialURL` may not return the initial URL correctly.  The issue is often related to the Expo Go environment not correctly handling scheme-based URLs.
