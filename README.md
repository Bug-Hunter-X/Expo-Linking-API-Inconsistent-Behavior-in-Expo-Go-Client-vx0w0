# Expo Linking API Inconsistent Behavior in Expo Go Client

This repository demonstrates a bug related to the Expo `Linking` API when using the Expo Go client.  The issue centers around the inconsistent behavior of `Linking.addEventListener` and `Linking.getInitialURL` when handling deep links within Expo Go.

## Problem Description:

The `Linking` API, designed to handle deep linking, doesn't function as reliably in the Expo Go client as it does in a standalone app.  This inconsistency may result in deep links failing to open the app or triggering the wrong part of the application.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app in Expo Go.
3. Attempt to open a deep link using the scheme defined in the app's configuration (e.g., `my-app://some-route`).
4. Observe that the deep link may not correctly open the app or navigate to the intended route.  The event listener might not fire, and `Linking.getInitialURL` may return an unexpected result.

## Solution:

The solution involves ensuring proper configuration for handling deep links both within Expo Go and in a standalone application. This might involve adjusting the app's scheme and ensuring correct handling of the initial URL.  Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for a potential fix based on the problem's root cause.

## Additional Notes:

This bug is specifically related to the Expo Go client.  The `Linking` API typically functions correctly when running a standalone build of the app.  A possible workaround might involve adding more robust error handling to the link processing and improving fallback mechanisms.
